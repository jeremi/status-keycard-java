# Keycard Android SDK

This SDK simplifies integration with the [Status Keycard](https://github.com/status-im/status-keycard) in Android
applications. In this SDK you find both the classes needed for generic communication with SmartCards as well as classes
specifically addressing the Keycard.

To get started, check the file demo/src/main/java/im/status/keycard/app/MainActivity.java which a simple
demo application showing how the SDK works and what you can do with it.
